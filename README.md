# Blessed-React

This is the root of the `blessed-react` package.

`blessed-react` is a package based on the `blessed` TUI library (currently using `reblessed` fork) which makes it possible to create terminal user interfaces using the JSX syntax and React-like function components.

The repository is split into three folders:
- `blessed-react-scaffold`:  
  A package enabling easier creation of `blessed-react` projects, with `tsconfig.json` preconfigured for easy bootstrap.

- `blessed-react-core`:  
  The main folder housing the `blessed-react` project per se.

- `testing-app`:  
  A folder for various tests and examples.
